# Watson Reminder

Simple project using Watson from IBM Cloud. Watson is a question-answering system capable of answering questions, developed by IBM.

This project was developed in 2017 at the International Hackathon that my university (Pontifical University of Salamanca, Spain) organised with the Polytechnic Institute of Viseu, Portugal. It was my first time attending a hackathon and coding with people from other countries. The result was not the best among all the teams' ideas but it was a very enjoyable first time. This is why I decided to keep it here.
